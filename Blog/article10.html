          The Falmer, also known as the Snow Elves, were once a proud and noble
          race that inhabited the snowy lands of Skyrim. However, a tragic turn
          of events led to their downfall, transforming them into the feared and
          twisted creatures known as the Falmer that players encounter in the
          game.
          <br /><br />
          In ages past, the Snow Elves coexisted with the Nords and other races
          of Skyrim. They possessed a deep affinity for magic and were skilled
          craftsmen, renowned for their elegance and beauty. Their cities, such
          as the legendary city of Snowhawk, stood as testaments to their
          advanced civilization.
          <br /><br />
          The turning point in the Snow Elves' history came when the Nords
          arrived in Skyrim. The two races clashed in a violent conflict known
          as the Night of Tears, resulting in the destruction of the Snow Elves'
          most sacred temple, Saarthal. Overwhelmed and on the verge of
          annihilation, the Snow Elves sought refuge with the Dwemer, the
          dwarven race known for their advanced technology.
          <br /><br />
          However, the alliance with the Dwemer proved to be their undoing. The
          Falmer were betrayed and enslaved by their supposed allies, who
          subjected them to horrific experiments and twisted rituals that
          stripped away their sight, turned them into underground dwellers, and
          transformed them into monstrous beings.
          <br /><br />
          Now known as the Falmer, these once noble elves have become blind,
          savage creatures that dwell in the depths of Skyrim's caverns and
          Dwemer ruins. They have lost their former grace and intellect, reduced
          to a feral existence focused on survival and revenge against their
          former oppressors.
          <br /><br />
          Encountering the Falmer presents a formidable challenge for players
          exploring Skyrim. They attack with ruthless aggression, utilizing
          their heightened senses of hearing and smell to detect intruders in
          their dark and labyrinthine dwellings. Armed with deadly weapons and a
          mastery of ambush tactics, the Falmer pose a constant threat to those
          who dare to venture into their domain.
          <br /><br />
          The lore surrounding the Falmer highlights themes of tragedy,
          betrayal, and the devastating consequences of conflict. Their
          transformation serves as a cautionary tale, a reminder of the darkness
          that can consume even the most illustrious of races when subjected to
          cruelty and desperation.
          <br /><br />
          Throughout the game, players can uncover the remnants of Snow Elf
          culture, such as ruins, artifacts, and lore books, offering glimpses
          into the glory that once defined this ancient race. The questline
          "Touching the Sky" allows players to delve further into Snow Elf
          history and play a part in potentially redeeming the Falmer.
          <br /><br />
          The Falmer lore in Skyrim is a poignant reminder of the harsh
          realities of the world and the lasting impact of past atrocities. It
          offers players a deeper understanding of the complexities and
          consequences of conflicts between races, while providing challenging
          encounters and an opportunity for exploration in the depths of
          Skyrim's underground realms.
